# 1. setup    
- create a new repo on github and follow the direction to next step    
    - in private mode    
    - add collobrates      
    - add rule to require a review before merge      
- Create a directory for a project         
- initial a git repository at the local computer     
> git init    

- git remote add    
#

# 5. Git Branch Model  

1. Create a new branch off from the develop branch and Switched to a new branch "myfeature"

```
$ git checkout -b myfeature develop
```

```
$ git checkout develop # Switch back to branch 'develop'

$ git merge --no-ff myfeature # merge the change in myfeature branch back to 'develop' branch.   
Updating ea1b82a..05e9557  
(Summary of changes)  
$ git branch -d myfeature # Delet the branch named 'myfeature' (was 05e9557).  
$ git push origin develop  
```  
 
The --no-ff flag causes the merge to always create a new commit object, even if the merge could be performed with a fast-forward. This avoids losing information about the historical existence of a feature branch and groups together all commits that together added the feature.

```
> git log --oneline # find the commit id
> git checkout d45c57a # git reflog to see the index. 
> git log --all 
> git checkout master # go back to the master branch  
> git checkout your-branch # go back to your branch

If you want to go back to any commit you previously checked out (either 1, 2, or 3 etc steps) then you can take a look at git reflog
> git reflog # 
# Git only requires a network connection on fetch/push/pull operations.
# git a dog
git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
```

```
Commit changes you want to keep. If you want to take over any of the changes you made in detached HEAD state, commit them. Like:

> git commit -a -m "your commit message"
Discard changes you do not want to keep. The hard reset will discard any uncommitted changes that you made in detached HEAD state:

> git reset --hard
(Without this, step 3 would fail, complaining about modified uncommitted files in the detached HEAD.)

Check out your branch. Exit detached HEAD state by checking out the branch you worked on before, for example:

> git checkout master
Take over your commits. You can now take over the commits you made in detached HEAD state by cherry-picking, as shown in my answer to another question.

> git reflog
> git cherry-pick <hash1> <hash2> <hash3> â€¦
# Since "detached head state" has you on a temp branch, just use 
> git checkout - # which puts you on the last branch you were on.
```
