## **"It's really important to do something instead of worrying about what end result will be"** 
-*Mark Zuckerberg*

This learn as you do method really makes you do something you think you cant   

 Mark Zuckerberg had a background in CS before college, but his level of knowledge in this video (2? Years after starting fb) is incredible. It really goes to show how much you can learn in a short period of time, and the value of just believing you can and will learn something as complicated as scaling fb to millions as a 21 year old. This video makes me want to start a company in order to learn like crazy  
 
 Amazing piece of history. Even at 21, Mark Zuckerberg shows a ton of intelligence and engineering know-how as well as business acumen. A lot of what he discussed in terms of parallelizing computation across partitioned databases, caching strategies, etc would be considered advanced for today's systems, but this was back in 2005. Interesting how some modern important concepts such as privacy are touched on in this lecture.  
 
 Harvard: "Mark Zuckerburg is a good influence"
Mark: "This is like the first times I have been to a lecture at Harvard..."  

Great things not always begin big
