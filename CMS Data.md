## *[readmission measure resources, including planned admission](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/measures/readmission/resources)*. Recently, AHRQ released new versions called the CCS-Refined (CCSR). While these versions undergo testing for use in the planned readmission algorithm, measures will use a YNHHSC/CORE-modified v2.0 of the AHRQ Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP)’s beta version 2019.1 CCS for ICD-10-CM/PCS for measure calculation. The YNHHS/CORE-modified crosswalk between the AHRQ CCS diagnosis/procedure categories and ICD-10-CM/PCS codes can be downloaded [here, open in a new browser window](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/files/627d0572b1ccb90016b538fd?filename=YaleMod_CCS_PCS_CM_Map_v2022.xlsx).

- 2022 - the total number of CPT codes to 10,819 per the AMA

- HCPCS comprises two medical code sets, HCPCS Level I and HCPCS Level II.

- HCPCS Level I consists of the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT®) code set and is used to submit medical claims to payers for procedures and services performed by physicians, nonphysician practitioners, hospitals, laboratories, and outpatient facilities.

HCPCS Level II is the national procedure code set for healthcare practitioners, providers, and medical equipment suppliers when filing health plan claims for medical devices, supplies, medications, transportation services, and other items and services.

When medical coders and billers talk about HCPCS codes, they're referring to HCPCS Level II codes. When they talk about CPT® coding, they’re actually referring to HCPCS Level I.

HCPCS Codes
•	Level I codes consist of the AMA's CPT codes and is numeric.
  o	Level I HCPCS (CPT-4 codes) for hospital providers
  o	Level I of the HCPCS is comprised of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT-4) , a numeric coding system maintained by the American Medical Association (AMA).
•	Level II codes are the HCPCS alphanumeric code set and primarily include non-physician products, supplies, and procedures not included in CPT.

SNOMED is clinically-based, documents whatever is needed for patient care and has better clinical coverage than ICD. It is used directly by healthcare providers during the process of care.

## [The 4 C's with SDOH ](https://www.hfma.org/topics/finance-and-business-strategy/article/the-4-cs-of-social-determinants-of-health.html)
Healthcare providers can follow these key elements to address social determinants of health (SDOH) that impact patient outcomes and costs, according to Nicole Ashley, COO of Wellopp. An important consideration is building partnerships with community resources and possible business partners to accomplish these goals.

- Community. Hospitals, health systems, other providers and payers should coordinate to develop customized local lists of community resources based on specific population health needs.  
- Care. Use screening to identify patient SDOH challenges.  
- Coordinate. Based on screening results, the healthcare provider alerts the clinician or care team of patients that may be high-risk based on SDOH factors (e.g., food scarcity, transportation challenges, income barriers).  
- Connect. The healthcare provider reaches out to both the patient and the appropriate community resource to make a connection and help ensure needed services are accessed. An alert system should be in place to notify providers that a connection cannot be made.
