- safe, timely, effective, efficient, equitable and patient-centered

## the Triple Aim

 better patient outcomes   
 improved patient satisfaction  
 lower costs  
 
 ## Quadruple Aim
 
 includes physician and health care professional well-being  
 
 ## How to measure the quality of care   
 
 Qulity of care made up of outcomes, safety and service—divided by the total cost of patient care over time
 
 ## An ideal high-value health care system features six key components:    
 - a clear, shared vision with the patient at the center; 
 - leadership and professionalism of health care workers; 
 - a robust IT infrastructure; 
 - broad access to care; 
 - and payment models that reward quality improvement over volume. 
 But the U.S. health care system was never deliberately designed to include these attributes.
 
 Physicians play crucial roles in moving the health care system toward this model 
 - minimizing low-value care and 
 - focusing on care that is high value and necessary. 
 - The first step is to identify and classify gaps that lead to waste, errors and missed opportunities. 
 - These include 
    - overuse, when care has a greater potential for harm than benefit; 
    - misuse, when appropriate care is selected but results in preventable complications; 
    - and underuse, when opportunities to provide high-value care are missed.
