# Medicare Advantage Overview  
- CMS pays each Medicare Advantage Organization (MAO) a monthly per-person amount for each beneficiary enrolled in its plan.   
- The plan’s bid determines the payment rates.   
- The MAO submits it to CMS on an annual basis.   
- The per-person amount paid to each plan for enrolled beneficiaries adjusts to account for differences in health status between enrolled beneficiaries. This is a “risk adjustment” model, and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) authorizes it.   
- From 1997 to present, there have been several different types of risk adjustment models.  
- But, in 2004, CMS selected a new risk adjustment model to begin using for payment: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Hierarchical Condition Categories (CMS-HCC) model, which includes diagnoses recorded on professional, inpatient, and outpatient claims.

# CMS-HCC MODEL OVERVIEW  
- ref: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/Downloads/RTC-Dec2018.pdf  
- The CMS-HCC model is prospective where data is collected in the base year to determine expected costs for the following year (the “prediction” year). For example, data from 2019 (base year) will predict expenses in 2020 (prediction year).   
- Each segment of the CMS-HCC model relies on data from demographics (i.e. patient’s age and gender) and health status.   
- These are based on ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes to predict costs.   
- To identify the disease diagnoses that predict future healthcare costs, HCC models first organize diseases/conditions into body systems or disease processes, called diagnostic groups (DXGs).   
- The disease processes within each diagnostic group (DXG) fall into condition categories (CCs).   
- Then, delineated into the HCC. ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes rank into categories that represent conditions with similar cost patterns.   
- There are over 9,500 ICD-10-CM codes that map to one or more of the 83 HCC codes included in the 2019 CMS-HCC Risk Adjustment Model (Version 23).
