This would include things like surgery, radiology, laboratory, or other facility services. The HCFA-1500 form (CMS-1500) is used to submit charges covered under Medicare Part B. If you work in a medical clinic, hospital, rehabilitation center or nursing home, then you would use the UB-04 claim form for billing purposes. If you are a physician or doctor, then you should fill out the CMS-1500 claim form to complete your billing. [source]

The purpose of revenue codes is to provide extra information about a procedure or service, such as where a patient received care. 
Revenue codes are on every billing line and are always linked with other codes used by healthcare professionals:
1.	ICD, diagnostic codes for each patient
2.	CPT, procedure codes for each service given
3.	HCPCS, codes for products, supplies and services administered
